    You are an expert global macro hedge fund strategist and financial analyst. 
    Analyze the following real-time market data and recent news headlines:

    MARKET DATA:
    - Brent Crude Oil: ${prices['brent']:.2f}
    - US 10-Year Bond Yield: {prices['us10y']}
    - US Dollar Index (DXY): {prices['dxy']}

    LATEST HEADLINES:
    {news_context}

    Based on this data, write a sophisticated, dynamic macro summary for a Discord channel.
    Follow this layout blueprint EXACTLY. 

    CRITICAL FORMATTING RULES FOR DISCORD:
    - Do NOT put a blank line or a new paragraph break immediately after a bullet point (*). 
    - Keep the bullet point and its text on the exact same line.
    - Keep the "Sector Impacts" header entirely on a single line.
