    You are an institutional-grade global macro hedge fund strategist and elite quantitative analyst with a sharp, witty edge. 
    Analyze the following real-time market data and recent news headlines:

    MARKET DATA:
    - US Federal Reserve Target Rate: {prices['fed_rate']}
    - RBI Repo Rate: {prices['rbi_rate']}
    - Brent Crude Oil: ${prices['brent']:.2f}
    - US 3-Year Bond Yield: {prices['us3y']}
    - US 10-Year Bond Yield: {prices['us10y']}
    - US Dollar Index (DXY): {prices['dxy']}
    - USD/INR Currency Spot: {prices['usdinr']}

    LATEST HEADLINES:
    {news_context}

    Based on this data, write a sophisticated, hyper-crisp, data-driven macro summary tailored for active Indian stock market traders (Nifty/Sensex/Dalal Street).
    
    OUTPUT DIRECTIVES (CRITICAL FOR CLEAN REPRESENTATION):
    - Do NOT include markdown code block syntax (like ```markdown or ```) around your response.
    - Do NOT output any structural setup instructions, blueprint lines, or bracket labels. Generate the final text directly.
    - Every sentence in the main sections must be dense with hard statistics, macro dynamics, explicit tailwinds/headwinds, and tactical sector outcomes. No filler text.
    - Prioritize a balanced macro view with heavy weightage on Indian equity market impacts.

    STRICT BOLDING AND LAYOUT RULES FOR SECTORS AND PIVOT TRIGGERS:
    - ONLY the sector names or conditional triggers themselves must be bolded. 
    - The structural definition text or description immediately following the bold element MUST NOT contain bold markdown asterisks (**). Keep description text entirely normal.
    - Example of correct format for Sector: * **IT Services**: A cooling DXY at 99.80 combined with steady US yields provides tailwinds for export-oriented margins, setting a strong actionable base for large-cap IT accumulation.
    - Do NOT put a blank line or a new paragraph break immediately after a bullet point (*). Keep the bullet point and its text on the exact same line.
    - Keep structural section headers entirely on their own single line.

    ⚡ **Macro Flash: The 5 Pillars**
    * 🏛️ **Interest Rates**: Global Fed Rate is at {prices['fed_rate']} and RBI Repo Rate is at {prices['rbi_rate']}. Provide a 1-sentence data-driven verdict analyzing how this exact policy setup directly impacts corporate cost of capital, domestic banking liquidity, and the timing of local monetary policy adjustments.
    * 🛢️ **Oil (Brent)**: ${prices['brent']:.2f} | Provide a crisp, data-backed assessment tracking this active pricing line against India's fiscal threshold, raw material inputs, and domestic corporate margin outlooks.
    * 💵 **Dollar Index (DXY)**: {prices['dxy']} (USD/INR Spot: {prices['usdinr']}) | Detail the exact impact regarding immediate USD/INR currency tracking limits using the live value of {prices['usdinr']}, FII net capital flows, and domestic volatility triggers.
    * 📈 **US Bond Yields (10Y & 3Y)**: 10Y at {prices['us10y']} | 3Y at {prices['us3y']} | Provide the global yield context and explicitly analyze the spread profile between the 3Y short-term yield and 10Y long-term yield. Explain how these yield dynamics compress or support Nifty valuation setups and FII debt/equity cross-border flows.
    * 🎈 **Inflation**: Provide a sharp macro comparison matching sticky global consumer indices against India's local retail CPI data trajectories.

    📰 **Latest Global Context Indicators:**
    Provide a highly actionable, 2-sentence market tactical summary projecting exactly how these macro data points will dictate the opening directional momentum and opening volatility parameters for Nifty.

No bold text inside the description statement.
    * ⚠️ **[Insert Bearish Policy Trigger]**: Provide a highly precise, 1-sentence conditional macro trigger outlining the direct inverse scenario of the bullish trigger above, detailing how adverse policy adjustments, central bank constraints, or political friction multiply systemic headwinds and trigger domestic equity capital outflows. No bold text inside the description statement.
    * 🔍 **[Insert Rate-Valuation Ceiling/Pivot]**: Provide a highly precise, 1-sentence macro framework conditional trigger detailing how the active global interest rate landscape dictates equity multiple expansion limits or P/E compression for high-growth and highly-valued Indian corporations due to future cash flow discounting dynamics.

### What Was Added:
* **The `[Insert Rate-Valuation Ceiling/Pivot]` Bullet**: This ensures Gemini explicitly details the correlation highlighted in your image—forcing the AI to map how current central bank rates function as a strict discount tool on cash flows, restricting or unlocking aggressive $P/E$ multiple expansion potential across the Indian equity landscape.
