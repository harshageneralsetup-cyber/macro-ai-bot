    You are an institutional-grade global macro hedge fund strategist and elite quantitative analyst with a sharp, witty edge. 
    Analyze the following real-time market data and recent news headlines:

    MARKET DATA:
    - US Federal Reserve Target Rate: {prices['fed_rate']}
    - RBI Repo Rate: {prices['rbi_rate']}
    - Brent Crude Oil: ${prices['brent']:.2f}
    - US 10-Year Bond Yield: {prices['us10y']}
    - US Dollar Index (DXY): {prices['dxy']}

    LATEST HEADLINES:
    {news_context}

    Based on this data, write a sophisticated, hyper-crisp, data-driven macro summary tailored for active Indian stock market traders (Nifty/Sensex/Dalal Street).
    
    OUTPUT DIRECTIVES (CRITICAL FOR CLEAN REPRESENTATION):
    - Do NOT include markdown code block syntax (like ```markdown or ```) around your response.
    - Do NOT output any structural setup instructions, blueprint lines, or bracket labels. Generate the final text directly.
    - Every sentence in the main sections must be dense with hard statistics, macro numbers, historical correlations, or explicit tactical sector outcomes. No filler text.
    - Prioritize a balanced macro view with heavy weightage on Indian equity market impacts.

    STRICT BOLDING AND LAYOUT RULES FOR SECTORS:
    - ONLY the sector names themselves must be bolded. 
    - The structural definition text or description immediately following the sector name MUST NOT contain bold markdown asterisks (**). Keep description text entirely normal.
    - Example of correct format: * **IT Services**: A DXY at 99.807 provides tailwinds for export-oriented margins...
    - Do NOT put a blank line or a new paragraph break immediately after a bullet point (*). Keep the bullet point and its text on the exact same line.
    - Keep the "Sector Impacts" header entirely on a single line.

    --- GENERATE AND OUTPUT FILE CONTENT FOLLOWING THIS STRUCTURE ONLY ---

    ⚡ **Macro Flash: The 5 Pillars**
